# EEC181-Projects

This repository holds all labs done in the Digital Design Senior Project from Winter 2016 through Spring 2016. </br>
The class had both guided and unguided labs that involved development on the Altera DE1-SoC board. The guided labs are to help to understand the features that are available on the the DE1-SoC board. These labs included how to access memory, loading a Linux Kernel onto the FPGA, as well as interactions between a processing core (ARM A9 processor in this case) with the FPGA fabric. </br>

The design project aspect consisted of designing an FPGA based image recognition system. The images that it was processing were handwritting images (28x28) and being able to recognize the value that was written at an extremely fast rate. </br>

The final design can be found in the Final Project - FPGA Implementation of Neural Network folder. It achieved <b>second</b> place in the competition withint eh class. The class had 8 different groups. The results of our implementation as well as a report detailing our design can be found in there. </br>

Our team would like to thank Professor Soheil Ghiasi and Mohammad Motamedi for assisting us throughout the past two quarters in designing the lab.
